<h4>1ST PLACE WINNER- Augmented Reality First Aid Android Application (Unity/C#, Vuforia, ARCore):</h4>
<p> The Android application uses augmented reality to simulate different injuries and demonstrate how to care for those injuries.
There are interactive AR components with step by step instructions for users to learn effectively. 
This project was created with a group at UCI's ICSSC's 2 week Medical Application Jam.
</p>

<h4>UCI Biorobotics Engineering Laboratory Website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) -In Progress:</h4>
<p> In the process of creating a website for UCI’s biorobotics lab to show what they do and display their projects. 
The website includes a slide show of pictures of their lab, information about the professors and students, and a map of where the lab is located using Google Maps API

<h4>FitYourGenes (HTML, CSS, Python, NodeJS, Bootstrap):</h4>
<p> This web application uses Genome Link API and Flask to output genomic data. It utilizes genomic data to determine which diseases users are susceptible to, 
	what nutritional deficiencies users have, and the body type of each user. 
The application returns information and personalizes foods, nutrients and exercises suggested for each individual.
I competed with a group at UC San Diego’s hackathon for 36 hours, and was a front-end developer.

<h4>Class Grade/Final Score Calculator Website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):</h4>
<p> This website asks the user to input information about their class
		(weights, total points, and their scores). It calculates and displays
		their total percentage in the class. The user can also choose to calculate
		what score they need to get on the final to get a specific grade in the class. </p>

<h4> Maze Generator/Solver (C++):</h4>
<p>The program generates an infinite amount of random mazes given any width from 10-50 cells wide and height from 10-50 cells tall. It also has the ability to solve any maze and acknowledges whether the maze has a solution.</p>

<h4> Othello (Python/ C++): </h4>
<p> The program runs a fully functional Othello game. The program asks the
		user for specifications for the game (rows, columns, which player goes first,etc.). The game logic, GUI, and Artificial Intelligence were written from scratch. </p>

<h4> Spending Tracker (Python): </h4>
<p> This program helps people set a budget and track their spending. If identified as a new user, a menu pops up, asking the person how much he or she wants to spend a day. If identified as a returning user, it already knows how much he or she wants to spend per day and it displays how much money the person has left. The user can open and close the application and keep inputting how much he or she spends that day and the program will constantly update itself. When it is a new day, the “money left to spend” will set itself back to the daily budget.  </p>

<h4> Cat Mario (GameSalad):</h4>
		<p> This is my first video game I created in high school. The game is like the classic Mario game except there are many more booby traps. The purpose of the game is to make people rage quit. </p>
