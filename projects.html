		<h3> Spending Tracker (Python) </h3>
		<div id="spendtrack" class= "projectimg">
		</div>
		<!--<img id="spendtrack" src="images/spendtrack.jpg">
		<img id="overspendtrack" src="images/overspendtrack.jpg">-->
		<p> This program helps people set a budget and track their spending. If identified as a new user, a menu pops up, asking the person how much he or she wants to spend a day. If identified as a returning user, it already knows how much he or she wants to spend per day and it displays how much money the person has left. The user can open and close the application and keep inputting how much he or she spends that day and the program will constantly update itself. When it is a new day, the “money left to spend” will set itself back to the daily budget.  </p>

		<h3> Troll Cat Mario (GameSalad)</h3>
