<h3>Lab Overview: </h3>
<img style="height:150px; width:250px; float:right; padding-left:20px" src="images/lab.jpg">
<p>Our group develops robotic and mechatronic devices that enhance 
human movement, motor learning, and rehabilitation. Many of these devices
are exoskeletons that attach to the arms or legs of people with a stroke 
or a spinal cord injury and assist in rehabilitation exercise of arm movements
or walking. We have also developed a robotic wheelchair that can assist
children and adults with a severe disability in learning how to drive
a powered wheelchair. We use these devices to study how people learn motor 
skills. We are particularly interested in whether training in robotic
environments can improve the performance of motor skills outside of the 
training environment. To guide the design of these environments, we try to 
understand the computational mechanisms of human motor learning and neural
plasticity.</p>
