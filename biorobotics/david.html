    <p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Research Interests:</strong></p>
    <p>Prof. Reinkensmeyer's research interests are in neuromuscular control, 
        motor learning, robotics, and rehabilitation. A major goal is to develop 
        physically interacting, robotic and mechatronic devices to help the nervous 
        system recover arm, hand, and leg movement ability after neurologic injuries 
        such as stroke and spinal cord injury. Another goal is to understand the 
        computational mechanisms of human motor learning, in order to provide a 
        rational basis for designing movement training devices. Prof. Reinkensmeyer's 
        laboratory has developed a variety of robotic devices for manipulating and 
        measuring movement in humans and rodents. These devices are being used to 
        investigate the role of mechanical assistance in retraining arm movement 
        following stroke, the feasibility of providing movement training remotely 
        using the Internet, and the role of sensory information in locomotor 
        plasticity after spinal cord injury.</p>

     <p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Biographical Sketch:</strong></p>
    <p>Dr. Reinkensmeyer received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering 
    from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge in 1988, and 
    the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University 
    of California, Berkeley in 1991 and 1993, with dissertation work on human 
    control of hand movements and robotic devices for movement therapy after 
    stroke. He was a postdoctoral fellow then research assistant professor in 
    the Sensory Motor Performance Program, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago 
    and Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Northwestern 
    University Medical School from 1994 – 1998. He joined U.C. Irvine in 
    1998 and is currently a Professor in the Department of Mechanical and 
    Aerospace Engineering, the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, and 
    the Department of Biomedical Engineering.</p>
